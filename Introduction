# Introduction
This is a web host where I can introduce myself : )

You can call me Luf or anything you want i dont mind.
Im working on a few projects, 1 of them being a companion that can follow me around in real life and play video games with me, a 🎮 🚗 **toy car for gaming with AI**🚗 🎮  on it. I will start this project on twitch and YT in the future maybe in 2027 aprox, I will also be a streamer at that time for gaming also with the AI so if interested be ready!!!
Im also working on a future video games too, it will be 2D with deep story telling i donr want to say much since this prodject will be very hard but i will post the links for the game on GOG and steam.

Im pretty decent with tech, maybe not the best but I know a few things. 

**Open DM's : )**

If you made it this far, Thank you I really apreciate it!
